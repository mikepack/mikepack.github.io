When ships pass in the night, who gives a shit?

Probably someone, somewhere. Especially if they were inches from colliding.

Like ships, teams rely on signals to avoid disaster.

A signal is the message you want people to hear. It conveys intent and prompts the right reaction.

Teams should speak in signals, not tasks, to steer projects together. Instead of broadcasting what you’re working on, ask: why should others care?

There are plenty of ways to send signals. Here’s a short list:
- I’m starting this because it unblocks X.
- I’m finishing this, now you can move on to Y.
- I want you to weigh in before I continue.
- I value this because it aligns with our goals.

Let me share a few examples of how signals show up at every level, from daily standups to executive direction.

# Daily Scrum
I see this ineffective standup ritual at almost every company. Everyone answers the same three questions: *What did you do yesterday? What are you doing today? What are your blockers?* You know the drill.

Here’s the problem:
- Yesterday’s work isn’t the point — what matters is how others should act on it.
- Today’s plan isn’t the point — what matters is how others should prepare to engage.
- Your blockers aren’t the point — what matters is whether the project’s at risk.

The difference is context. Effective standups put individual work in the context of the team. The speaker conveys intent instead of relying on others to piece it together.

Cut through the noise and send the signal outright:
> I’m wrapping up this API endpoint today, so Alice, you’ll be clear to start integrating your part.

The real challenge is knowing what to send, to whom, when, and in what setting. That’s the essence of good collaboration. People who are tuned into what others care about are far more effective. When you think in signals, the rest falls into place.

# Product Management
Just as standups reveal how individuals communicate, product management reveals how teams express intent to their partners.

“Product management” is a lot of “expectation management.” [Mind the Product](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/managing-expectations-product-management-at-startups/) puts it well: much of the job is managing how others perceive your intent.

Not all products are inherently good. What you’re building may make people uncomfortable. Your work may expose vulnerabilities, challenge beliefs, or stir up disagreement.

When you know someone may react negatively, think on their terms first. Express your intent clearly and address their concerns before they turn defensive.
> Bob, we’re exploring a feature that could raise flags. I’ve outlined how we’ll mitigate the risks and want to walk you through the plan so we’re aligned before moving forward.

Thoughtful expectation management sends a powerful signal. It shows you care about others, you’ve considered their perspective, and you’re in control of the outcome. You can’t always remove the side effects of your intentions, but you can shape how your signals land.

# Executive Direction
Whether you’re managing a feature or an organization, the principle is the same: your signals set the tone for how others act.

At an executive level, those signals cascade through the entire company.

A core skills of any executive is painting a vision that others can see and act on.

As [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2025/02/11/the-art-of-executive-communication-mastering-the-power-method/) puts it, effective executive communication comes down to aligning:
- Values: I value this, and so should you.
- Tact: I’ve considered how this impacts you.
- Grace: I’m clearly and simply delivering my intent.

Take automation, for example. You want to improve the bottom line, and automating jobs is the answer. Don’t say margins are important; paint the vision of scalability. Acknowledge that people fear job loss, and signal your commitment to progress that benefits both people and the business.

Executive signals travel far. Communicate with empathy and people will follow, even through uncomfortable change.

# Beaconing
The best leaders don’t stop at sending signals, they become something more enduring. As John Shedd said, “A ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for.”

Zoom out. There’s more to the task you’re working on, the product you’re creating, or the business you’re building. Find the larger purpose — the reason behind the work — and align your signals with the vision.

Good leaders send signals, but great leaders become beacons.

Teams navigate best when people consistently beacon their position, direction, and impact — everyone stops guessing at intent and starts rowing together. And when ships move together, no one drifts in the dark.
