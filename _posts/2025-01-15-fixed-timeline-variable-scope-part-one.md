Your company is likely caught in a common trap: overplanning innovation. It leaves product leaders frustrated by missed deadlines, engineers overwhelmed with endless work, and executives suffering whiplash from fluctuating roadmaps.

In this series, I'll make the case for rethinking how we approach software innovation. In part one, I’ll break down why the industry standard is broken and introduce a new framework. In part two, I’ll show you how to put this framework into action. And in part three, I’ll share insights from six years of applying it with real teams.

# The Innovation Spectrum

Product development boils down to two types of work: innovation and execution.

Innovation is ambiguous. The product vision might exist, but it’s often fuzzy, and the path forward is unclear. This work pushes the product into uncharted territory.

Execution is straightforward. The path to completion is clear, and everyone knows what to do. This work builds on what already exists.

Most projects fall somewhere along the spectrum between these two extremes.

# The Industry Standard

The age-old script goes like this: product asks, “how long will this take?” Engineering answers with an estimate. Spoiler alert, that estimate is probably wrong.

This process works well if the work skews heavily toward “execution” because product knows precisely what they want and engineering knows exactly how to get there. The estimates provided are reliable.

Engineering estimates are rarely reliable because few projects lean entirely toward execution — businesses don’t succeed by reinventing the wheel — and agile processes are not equipped to spec 6 months in advance (that's waterfall). So, when engineering provides an estimate it gets padded, or research tickets are created, or they are otherwise just wrong.

Building dozens of 0→1 products has taught me a hard truth: to estimate a 6-month project with ±10% accuracy, you must tirelessly spec every feature, effectively converting innovation projects into execution projects. More often than not, this stifles creativity and forces predictability over impact. Besides, we've already learned the perils of waterfall.

When the industry standard is applied to innovation work, everything fall apart. Since product doesn’t know exactly what they want and engineering isn’t quite sure how to get there, those estimates are like weather predictions a month from now, mostly fiction. Missed deadlines, stressed teams, and frustrated executives asking, “how do we avoid this next time?”. Sound familiar?

This recurring failure highlights a deeper issue: the reliance on fixed scope methodologies. Unless work is truly execution, or can be spiked enough to get sufficiently close, all the estimation workarounds are just symptoms of a deeper problem.

# The Fallacy of Fixed Scope

A fixed scope process defines all the work before you do it. The problem lies in the assumption that we know everything *before* doing the work. What hubris!

Nobody can predict the future, especially in innovation work, where uncertainty is the norm. That’s why we work in “sprints” to adapt as we go, tweaking the direction with each iteration. But these tweaks are usually variants on the same general direction, the same fixed scope. It’s quite rare that a team embarks on a multi-month epic and has the fortitude to admit they’re on the wrong path.

This is why agile often turns into “agilefall”. In theory, pivoting every two weeks sounds great, but political, technical, and psychological barriers often prevent it. Teams face resistance to altering roadmaps, the painful cost of undoing recent work, and the weight of sunk cost fallacies, shame, and overconfidence. It all leaves them struggling to chart the path forward.

The issue compounds when influential stakeholders — executives, product managers, engineers, and business partners — cling to their own idea of "done". This rigidity drags out timelines and stalls delivery until expectations are met.

Sadly, the worst shortcoming of fixed scope methodologies is they don’t foster collaboration. When scope is defined upfront, before getting into the hands of the team doing the implementation, it assumes those upstream of the implementation team (eg executives) have the best ideas and fails to leverage the vast pool of intelligence they’ve hired.

So, how do we overcome these obstacles and foster both agility and collaboration? The answer lies in fixed timelines with variable scope.

# The Case for Fixed Timelines

If everyone humbly acknowledges that we don’t know precisely what we want and commit to exploring our way into a solution, then we can more readily leverage other approaches.

A fixed timeline process involves specifying an “appetite” for a project, like four weeks, and allowing the scope to vary within that timeframe. It ensures teams spend no more than four weeks on a project, while keeping the outputs flexible.

Fixed timelines flip the script. Instead of asking, “how long will X take?” teams ask, “how much time are we willing to invest in X?” The latter encourages collaboration, creativity, and ruthless prioritization.

Innovation work inherently risks runaway scope, but time-boxing effectively contains it. Instead of eliminating ambiguity upfront — with spikes or exhaustive planning — fixed timelines embrace it, ensuring teams can adapt within clear boundaries.

I first discovered this approach in the [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} book, which offers many valuable insights. The most salient takeaway, however, is the concept of a fixed timeline.

Over the years, I’ve leveraged this framework for innovation projects with marked success. I’ve adapted the book’s principles to handle the complexity of healthcare, streamline processes, and maximize collaboration. I've shipped major overhauls to tools, launched brand new products, and built complex integrations. All on a fixed timeline. The result? Happier teams, better outcomes, and improved operational efficiency.

# Benefits

When used appropriately, this paradigm has many benefits. In Part Three, I'll expound on the benefits, the challenges, and what I mean by "appropriate". Here's a snapshot of the upside:

- *For product managers*: Roadmaps become easier to plan with timelines fixed on a defined appetite, reducing the need for day-to-day project management and freeing time for upstream activities like market discovery.
- *For engineering managers*: Teams become more collaborative because everyone knows what success looks like and discusses tradeoffs about the best use of their time.
- *For engineers*: Engineers want to solve business problems, not just implement prescribed solutions. Empowering them to get creative leads to greater fulfillment and better results.
- *For senior leaders*: Leaders gain more control over roadmaps by defining project appetite rather than relying on engineering estimates.
- *For executives*: Executives spend less time worrying about project minutiae (the “how”) and more time articulating the vision (the “why”).
- *For everyone*: Power and influence over project completion shifts to the people best equipped to deliver measurable outcomes: the implementation team.
