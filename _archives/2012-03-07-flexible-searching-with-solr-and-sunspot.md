I just posted an article on RubySource.com titled <a href="http://rubysource.com/flexible-searching-with-solr-and-sunspot/" target="_blank">Flexible Searching with Solr and Sunspot</a>. It covers working `Solr` into a Rails app and massaging `Solr` to match searches on your content.

Happy searching!
